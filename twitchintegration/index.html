                    <h3>How It Works</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Twitch Integration mod for Oxygen Not Included allows viewers to affect a streamer's colony
                        in real time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Options are presented to viewers at a regular interval. Viewers get the opportunity to vote for
                        the event that they would like to happen. Users vote by sending a message in chat
                        <span>containing only the number of the vote they want</span>.
                        After the voting time ends, the event with the most votes will be chosen. The chosen event will
                        begin immediately when the voting time ends.
                    </p>
                    <div class="alert alert-secondary">
                        Note: some events have an inherent delay, and even if it looks like
                        nothing is happening, it's likely processing in the background.
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        If two or more options are tied for the most votes, one of the tied votes is chosen at random.
                        If all options have 0 votes, nothing happens.
                    </p>

                            Download the mod using the link at the top of the page. Then launch Oxygen Not Included, go
                            to the Mods menu, and click the checkmark to enable the mod. Close the mod menu and let the
                            game restart.

                                    Log in to Twitch with the account that you want to send messages. This should be a
                                    broadcaster, mod, or VIP account, to make sure that it can bypass automod or similar
                                    filters.
