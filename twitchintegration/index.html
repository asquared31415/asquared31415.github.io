                    <h3>How It Works</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Twitch Integration mod for Oxygen Not Included allows viewers to affect a streamer's colony
                        in real time. With over 60 unique events, ranging from helpful to deadly, chaos is guaranteed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Options are presented to viewers at a regular interval. Viewers get the opportunity to vote for
                        the event that they would like to happen. Users vote by sending a message in chat
                        <span>containing only the number of the vote they want</span>.
                        After the voting time ends, the event with the most votes will be chosen. The chosen event will
                        begin immediately when the voting time ends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If two or more options are tied for the most votes, one of the tied votes is chosen at random.
                        If all options have 0 votes, nothing happens.
                    </p>
